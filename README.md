# libft
### About

Libft is the first project at 42, designed to build a strong foundation in C programming. In this project, I recreated many of the standard C library functions from scratch, ultimately creating a personal library. This project is crucial because this library will be used in future assignments throughout the 42 curriculum.

For 42 students: tackling this project on your own is highly recommended. Writing and testing your code thoroughly will help you truly understand the underlying concepts. If you've completed the piscine, you should be prepared to approach this project with patience and precision.
